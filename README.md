# rgb-depth-2-rgb-pcd
A repo for stereo camera calibration between rgb and depth (ir) camera in order to obtain a colourful point cloud. 
You can find more info [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-SvxfvDg1sxxhv0ZvO5Re6CqgFjvGiKPrxjO0B5l4Ys/edit?usp=sharing). 

Also you should be able to run the scripts for calibration (cameraCalibrationScript.m and stereoCameraCalibrationScript.m) just by changing the paths inside (if necessary) to your rectified images folder(s).
